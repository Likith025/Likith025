I'm diving into the world of embedded firmware development! Right now, I'm experimenting with STM32, ESP32, and Arduino to build cool projects and learn new things. Iâ€™m also getting into bare-metal programming and testing embedded systems.

ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m Learning:

C programming for embedded systems

Working with STM32CubeIDE, Keil

Embedded testing using Robot Framework & Unity
